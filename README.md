# senior-robotics
arduino code for robocup soccer open division

## team:
- john
- elvis
- leon
- ben
- angus
- kush

### Timeline and Plan:
- [ ] Work out new plate designs _(Week 1)_
- [ ] Work out new components, order and create schematic _(Weeks 1-3)_
- [ ] Begin testing of tactics (hardware + software) _(Weeks 2-5)_
- [ ] Construct robots, test, and finalise _(Weeks 4-7)_
- [ ] Final optimsation _(Weeks 7-8)_

_Todo:
- [ ] work out algorithms to figure out ball position and movement
- [ ] work out how to react to the ball position
- [ ] work out horizontal position of the bot for nudges etc

_Reminders:
- When ToF sensors installed, change compass' SCL and SDA pins to breadboard, and connect ToFs' to same line. All to connect to pins 20 and 21 on Arduino
- When ToF sensors installed, edit `/arduino/arduino.ino` and `/src/hardware/phobot/sensors.py` according to instructory comments

A note from our sponsors: _Congratulations on being runner up in the state competition, and now entering the national robotics competition!_
